Here, if A alters his course without any \\nintention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of \\navoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty \\nof an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an which he \\nknew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of \\nfact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse \\nhim in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the \\nconflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention in good \\nfaith of saving human life or property.

Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.--A \\nconsent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this \\nCode, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, \\nor has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence of \\nsuch fear or misconception; or \\nConsent of insane person. \\nConsent of insane person.-if the consent is given by a person \\nwho, from unsoundness of mind, or intoxication, is unable to \\nunderstand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n              \\n              \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n          \\n  \\n                  \\n             \\n             \\n               \\n           \\n \\n                              \\n \\n                \\n              \\n              \\n                  \\n               \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n            \\n  \\n                        \\n                 \\n                 \\n             \\n             \\n               \\n                 \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n               consent; or \\nConsent of child. \\nConsent of child.-unless the contrary appears from the context, if \\nthe consent is given by a person who is under twelve years of age. \\n91. \\nExclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause. \\n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm \\ncause.--The exceptions in sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts \\nwhich are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, or \\nbe intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person \\ngiving the consent, or on whose behalf the consent is given. \\nIllustration \\nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose \\nof saving the life of the woman) is offence inexpediently of any harm \\nwhich it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it \\nis not an offence \"by reason of such harm\"; and the consent of the \\nwoman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not \\njustify the act. \\n92. \\nAct done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent. \\n92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without \\nconsent.-Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may \\ncauses to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even \\nwithout that person\\'s consent, if the circumstances are such that it \\nis impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is \\nincapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in \\nlawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in \\ntime for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided-\\nProvisos. \\nProvisos.-First.-That this exception shall not extend to the \\nintentional causing of death or the attempting to cause death; 117  \\n                    \\n                                       \\n                               \\n \\n                          \\n                   \\n                \\n \\n                         \\n                   \\n        \\n \\n                             \\n \\n                   \\n             \\n             \\n           \\n                      \\n                  \\n                 \\n      \\n                   \\n            \\n             \\n               \\n       \\n \\n                        \\n                  \\n                   \\n            \\n                      \\n   \\n                  \\n       \\n  \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n \\n                \\n                 \\n             \\n \\n                              \\n \\n                       Secondly.-That this exception shall not extend to the doing \\nof anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or \\ngrievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or \\ninfirmity; \\nThirdly.-That this exception shall not extend to the \\nvoluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause hurt, \\nfor any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; \\nFourthly.-That this exception shall not extend to the \\nabetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it \\nwould not extend. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, \\nfinds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z\\'s death, but \\nin good faith, for Z\\'s benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers \\nhis power of judging for himself. A has committed no offence. \\n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it \\nto be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, \\nand in good faith intending Z\\'s benefit. A\\'s ball gives Z a mortal \\nwound. A has committed no offence. \\n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely \\nto prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. There is \\nnot time to apply to the child\\'s guardian. A performs the operation in \\nspite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good faith, the \\nchild\\'s benefit. A has committed no offence. \\n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People \\nbelow hold out a blanket. A drops the child, from the house-top, \\nknowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child\\'s \\nbenefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has \\ncommitted no offence. \\nExplanation.-Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the \\nmeaning of sections 88 89 and 92. \\n93. \\nCommunication made in good faith. \\n93. Communication made in good faith.--No communication made in \\ngood faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the person to whom \\nit is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. \\nIllustration \\nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his                \\n              \\n       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n         \\n \\n                       \\n           \\n                  \\n                   \\n             \\n                 \\n             \\n                 \\n    \\n                   \\n                   \\n               \\n              \\n      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n               \\n    \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n                   \\n                 \\n                   \\n           \\n                          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n 118 opinion that he cannot live.

Act to which a person is compelled by threats.--Except \\nmurder, and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing \\nis an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by \\nthreats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonnably cause the \\napprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own \\naccord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of \\ninstant death, place himself in the situation by which he became \\nsubject to such constraint. \\nExplanation 1.-A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a \\nthreat of being beaten, joins a gang of dacoits, knowing their \\ncharacter, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the \\nground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything \\nthat is an offence by law. \\nExplantion 2.-A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, \\nby threat of instant death, to do a thing which is an offence by law; \\nfor example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door \\nof a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the \\nbenefit of this exception. \\n95. \\nAct causing slight harm. \\n95. Act causing slight harm.--Nothing is an offence by reason \\nthat it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it is known \\nto be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. \\nOf the Right of Private Defence \\n96. \\nThings done in private defence.                 \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n          \\n \\n \\n                 \\n             \\n   \\n \\n                         \\n            \\n \\n                    \\n                                       \\n                    \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n              \\n \\n  \\n                       \\n               \\n                  \\n          \\n              \\n                   \\n                  \\n \\n \\n                             \\n \\n                    \\n                  \\n        \\n \\n                      \\n             \\n             \\n               \\n        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          96.

Right of private defence of the body and of property.--Every \\nperson has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section \\n99, to defend -\\nFirst.--His own body, and the body of any other person, \\nagainst any offence affecting the human body; \\nSecondly.--The property, whether movable or immovable, of \\nhimself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence falling under the defintion of theft, robbery, mischief \\nor criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, \\nrobbery, mischief or criminal trespass. \\n98. \\nRight of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, \\netc. \\n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of \\nunsound mind, etc.--When an act which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of \\nmaturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication \\nof the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private \\ndefence against that act which he would have if the act were that \\noffence. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is \\nguilty of no offence.

D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. \\nExplanation 3.-It is not necessary that the person abetted should \\nbe capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to \\ncommit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person \\ncapable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention \\nas A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of \\nabetting an offence. \\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child \\nunder seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z\\'s death. B, in \\nconsequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and \\nthereby causes Z\\'s death. Here, though B was not capable by law of \\ncommitting an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner \\nas if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had \\ncommitted murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of \\ndeath. \\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in \\nconsequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing \\nthe nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary \\nto law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A\\'s instigation. B \\nhas committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of \\nsetting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment \\nprovided for that offence. \\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B \\nto take property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession. A induces B to \\nbelieve that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A\\'s property. B, \\nacting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and \\ntherefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, \\nand is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \\nExplanation 4.-The abetment of an offence being an offence, the \\nabetment of such an abetment is also an offence. \\nIllustration \\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly \\ninstigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of \\nB\\'s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the \\npunishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A \\nis also liable to the same punishment. \\nExplanation 5.-It is not necessary to the commission of the \\noffence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the 122              \\n           \\n \\n                              \\n                        \\n             \\n                     \\n             \\n                    \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n            \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n       \\n  \\n               \\n              \\n              \\n        \\n                               \\n                    \\n         \\n  \\n \\n  \\n            \\n          \\n                     \\n                      \\n             \\n            \\n                \\n       \\n                        \\n              \\n             \\n   \\n \\n                             \\n \\n                        \\n                offence with the person who commits it.

C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and \\ndelivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner \\nexplained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in \\nthe conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered.

B sets fire to the house \\nand at the same time commits theft of property there. A, though guilty \\nof abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the \\ntheft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable \\nconsequence of the burning. \\n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at \\nmidnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for \\nthat purpose.

Giving false evidence.--Whoever, being legally bound by an \\noath or by an express provision of law to state the truth, or being \\nbound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any \\nstatement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be \\nfalse or does not believe to be true, is said to give false evidence. \\nExplanation 1.-A statement is within the meaning of this section \\nwhether it is made verbally or otherwise. \\nExplanation 2.-A false statement as to the belief of the person \\nattesting is within the meaning of this section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing \\nwhich he does not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing \\nwhich he does not know. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one \\nthousand rupees, falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z admit the \\njustice of B\\'s claim. A has given false evidence. \\n(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he \\nbelieves a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when he does \\nnot believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he \\nknows to be false, and therefore gives false evidence. \\n(c) A, knowing the general character of Z\\'s handwriting, states \\nthat he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z; A in \\ngood faith believing it to be so. Here A\\'s statement is merely as to \\nhis belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, although the \\nsignature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence.  \\n                    \\n                    \\n              \\n          \\n                  \\n            \\n               \\n             \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n            \\n                \\n                    \\n           \\n             \\n            \\n              \\n                   \\n                 \\n             \\n \\n \\n                             \\n \\n                    \\n                 \\n                \\n \\n                      \\n                   \\n   \\n \\n                        \\n           \\n                    \\n                 \\n               \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n             \\n              (d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he \\nknows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not knowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z \\nwas at that place on the day named or not. \\n(e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true \\ninterpretation or translation of a statement or document, which he is \\nbound by oath to interpret or translate truly, that which is not and \\nwhich he does not believe to be a true interpretation or translation. \\nA has given false evidence. \\n192. \\nFabricating false evidence. \\n192. Fabricating false evidence.--Whoever causes any circumstance \\nto exist or makes any false entry in any book or record, or makes any \\ndocument containing a false statement, intending that such \\ncircumstance, false entry or false statement may appear in evidence in \\na judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law before a public \\nservant as such, or before an arbitrator, and that such circumstance, \\nfalse entry or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause \\nany person who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the \\nevidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion touching any point \\nmaterial to the result of such proceeding is said \"to fabricate false \\nevidence\". \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A puts jewels into a box belonging to Z, with the intention \\nthat they may be found in that box, and that this circumstance may \\ncause Z to be convicted of theft. A has fabricated false evidence. \\n(b) A makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of \\nusing it as corroborative evidence in a Court of Justice. A has \\nfabricated false evidence. \\n(c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a \\ncriminal conspiracy, writes a letter in imitation of Z\\'s handwriting, purporting to be addressed to an accomplice in such criminal \\nconspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that the \\nofficers of the police are likely to search. A has fabricated false evidence. \\n193. \\nPunishment for false evidence. \\n193.

Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, \\nintending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z\\'s death, \\ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be \\nguilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, \\nkills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there.

But it may amount to culpable homicide \\nto cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has \\nbeen brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been \\ncompletely born. \\n300. \\nMurder. \\n300. Murder.--Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable \\nhomicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done \\nwith the intention of causing death, or-\\n2ndly.-If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily \\ninjury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the \\nperson to whom the harm is caused. or-\\n3rdly.-If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury \\nto any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is \\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or-\\n4thly.-If the person committing the act knows that it is so \\nimminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or \\nsuch bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act \\nwithout any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such \\ninjury as aforesaid. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in \\nconsequence. A commits murder. \\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a \\nblow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of \\ncausing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty \\nof murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound                 \\n               \\n                \\n               \\n                \\n      \\n \\n                \\n                 \\n               \\n     \\n \\n                     \\n               \\n           \\n \\n                  \\n              \\n             \\n               \\n     \\n \\n              \\n               \\n              \\n                  \\n              \\n      \\n \\n                  \\n         \\n \\n              \\n             \\n \\n \\n                              \\n \\n                   \\n            \\n                 \\n              \\n   \\n \\n                         \\n                 \\n                  \\n                    \\n \\n \\n                        \\n             \\n                  \\n       168 state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any \\ndisease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of \\nnature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he \\nmay intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did \\nnot intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary \\ncourse of nature would cause death. \\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient \\nto cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies \\nin consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have \\nintended to cause Z\\'s death. \\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of \\npersons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may \\nnot have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\nException 1.-When culpable homicide is not murder.-Culpable \\nhomicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power \\nof self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of \\nthe person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other \\nperson by mistake or accident. \\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos: -\\nFirst.-That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked \\nby the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person. \\nSecondly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in \\nobedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of \\nthe powers of such public servant. \\nThirdly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in \\nthe lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \\nExplanation.-Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough \\nto prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation \\ngiven by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z\\'s child. This is murder, inasmuch \\nas the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the \\nchild was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused \\nby the provocation. \\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this \\nprovocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A \\nkills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. \\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to \\nsudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.  \\n                   \\n                 \\n                 \\n   \\n                     \\n                \\n             \\n               \\n        \\n \\n                 \\n              \\n                 \\n             \\n     \\n \\n                 \\n               \\n                  \\n                   \\n          \\n          \\n \\n                              \\n \\n                        \\n               \\n              \\n              \\n    \\n \\n                  \\n                  \\n            \\n               \\n                  \\n            \\n \\n                  \\n              \\n          \\n        \\n                  \\n       \\n \\n                   \\n             \\n           \\n \\n \\n                               \\n (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he \\ndoes not believe a word of A\\'s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. \\nThis is murder. \\n(e) A attempts to pull Z\\'s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right \\nof private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is \\nmoved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This \\nis murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by a thing done in \\nthe exercise of the right of private defence. \\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. \\nA, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B\\'s rage, and to cause \\nhim to kill Z, puts a knife into B\\'s hand for that purpose. B kills Z \\nwith the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\nException 2.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in \\nthe exercise in good faith of the right of private defence or person \\nor property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the \\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of \\ndefence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more \\nharm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\nIllustration \\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause \\ngrievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A \\nbelieving in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself \\nfrom being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, \\nbut only culpable homicide. \\nException 3.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, \\nbeing a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the \\nadvancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to \\nbe lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such \\npublic servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is \\ncaused. \\nException 4.-Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed \\nwithout premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a \\nsudden quarrel and without the offender\\'s having taken undue advantage \\nor acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\nExplanation.-It is immaterial in such cases which party offers \\nthe provocation or commits the first assault. \\nException 5.-Culpable homicide is not murder when the person \\nwhose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers \\ndeath or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\nIllustration 169                 \\n              \\n             \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n             \\n   \\n \\n \\n                    \\n           \\n                 \\n               \\n            \\n             \\n               \\n        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n                  \\n               \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n \\n             \\n                \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n        \\n \\n                \\n              \\n             \\n               \\n                   \\n             A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen \\nyears of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z\\'s youth, he was \\nincapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted \\nmurder. \\n301. \\nCulpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose \\ndeath was intended. \\n301. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than \\nperson whose death was intended.--If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither \\nintends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide \\ncommitted by the offender is of the description of which it would have \\nbeen if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended \\nor knew himself to he likely to cause. \\n302. \\nPunishment for murder. \\n302.

Subs, by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and Sch., for \"transportation for \\nlife \". \\nExplanation 2.-A moving effected by the same act which effects \\nthe severance may be a theft. \\nExplanation 3.-A person is said to cause a thing to move by \\nremoving an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating \\nit from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \\nExplanation 4.-A person, who by any means causes an animal to \\nmove, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in \\nconsequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \\nExplanation 5.-The consent mentioned in the definition may be \\nexpress or implied, and may be given either by the person in \\npossession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either \\nexpress or implied. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z\\'s ground, with the intention of \\ndishonestly taking the tree out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent. \\nHere, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\\'s \\ndog to follow it. Here, if A\\'s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z\\'s dog has begun to follow A. \\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the \\nbullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \\n(d) A being Z\\'s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\\'s \\nplate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z\\'s consent. A has committed theft. \\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of \\na warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith \\nand sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\\'s possession. It could not \\ntherefore be taken out of Z\\'s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.  \\n                     \\n                \\n     \\n                    \\n              \\n    \\n \\n                      \\n                \\n                \\n                  \\n               \\n                  \\n \\n \\n                      \\n                   \\n                \\n               \\n                   \\n            \\n    \\n \\n \\n                           \\n              \\n              \\n              \\n   \\n \\n                      \\n             \\n               \\n      \\n                        \\n            \\n                        \\n      \\n                     \\n             \\n             \\n              \\n                     \\n  \\n                       \\n              \\n               \\n         \\n                   \\n                 188 (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z \\noccupies. Here the ring is in Z\\'s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession \\nof any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit \\ncriminal misappropriation of property. \\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\\'s house. \\nNot venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of \\nsearch and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly \\nimprobable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of \\ntaking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is \\nforgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits \\ntheft. \\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z \\ncarries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, \\nenters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\\'s hand, and \\ncarries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal \\ntrespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did \\nwas not done dishonestly. \\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z \\nretains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the \\nwatch out of Z\\'s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the \\nproperty as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he \\ntakes it dishonestly. \\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of \\nZ\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, not having paid what he borrowed \\non the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession \\nwithout Z\\'s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in \\nZ\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z\\'s implied \\nconsent to use Z\\'s book. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not \\ncommitted theft. \\n(n) A asks charity from Z\\'s wife. She gives A money, food and \\nclothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable \\nthat A may conceive that Z\\'s wife is authorized to give away alms. If \\nthis was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n(o) A is the paramour of Z\\'s wife. She gives a valuable property, \\nwhich A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as                       \\n    \\n \\n                  \\n               \\n         \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n                    \\n            \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            \\n         \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n           \\n \\n \\n                      \\n             \\n                                      \\n            \\n           \\n  \\n \\n  \\n             \\n       \\n \\n \\n                    \\n             \\n                   \\n                   she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property \\ndishonestly, he commits theft. \\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\\'s \\nown property, takes that property out of B\\'s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n379. \\nPunishment for theft. \\n379.

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the \\nsum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter.

A has committed forgery. \\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to \\nbearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A \\nfraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand \\nrupees. A commits forgery. \\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by \\nA, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the \\ncheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the \\npurpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque \\nby inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B \\nwithout B\\'s authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with \\na banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A \\ndraws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the \\nbill, A is guilty of forgery. \\n(f) Z\\'s will contains these words-\"I direct that all my remaining \\nproperty be equally divided between A, B and C.\" A dishonestly \\nscratches out B\\'s name, intending that it may be believed that the            \\n \\n                 \\n                  \\n              \\n             \\n       \\n \\n                   \\n               \\n                  \\n                   \\n          \\n \\n                       \\n                 \\n            \\n     \\n \\n                       \\n                    \\n            \\n              \\n                \\n   \\n \\n                    \\n                  \\n            \\n              \\n        \\n \\n \\n \\n                   \\n \\n \\n                             \\n \\n                   \\n               \\n     \\n \\n                   \\n                  \\n               \\n                 \\n               \\n     \\n                          \\n                  \\n              \\n            \\n                        \\n                205 whole was left to himself and C.

B dishonestly erases the words \\n\"Pay to Z or his order\", and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. \\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to \\ndefraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B \\nbefore he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery. \\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a \\ndifferent legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has \\nprepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the \\nwill. A has committed forgery. \\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B\\'s name without B\\'s \\nauthority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in \\ndistressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by \\nmeans of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as \\nA made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A \\nhas committed forgery. \\n(k) A without B\\'s authority writes a letter and signs it in B\\'s \\nname certifying to A\\'s character, intending thereby to obtain \\nemployment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to \\ndeceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter \\ninto an express or implied contract for service. \\nExplanation I.-A man\\'s signature of his own name may amount to \\nforgery. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it \\nmay be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery. \\n(b) A writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it \\nwith Z\\'s name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bills as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing \\nthe fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A\\'s intention, B \\nis also guilty of forgery. \\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a \\ndifferent person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own \\nname, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the \\nperson to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree \\nagainst B.

B, though he executes the lease in his own \\nname, commits forgery by antedating it. \\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects \\nwith B for A\\'s benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and \\nin order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note \\nbinding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates \\nthe note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the \\nfirst head of the definition. \\nExplanation 2.-The making of a false document in the name of a \\nfictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was \\nmade by real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it \\nto be believed that the document was made by the person in his \\nlifetime, may amount to forgery. \\nIllustration \\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and \\nfraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person \\nwith intent to negotiate it.

Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.--Nothing which is done in pursuance of, or which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice, if done whilst such judgment or order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such judgment or order, provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the Court had such jurisdiction. 79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law. 79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law.--Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it. Illustration A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. 80. Accident in doing a lawful act. 80. Accident in doing a lawful act.--Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful means and with proper care and caution. Illustration A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. 81.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   115 Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm. 81. Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.--Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. Explanation.-It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm. Illustrations (a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. (b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence. 82. Act of a child under seven years of age. 82. Act of a child under seven years of age.--Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age. 83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding.--Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. 84. Act of a person of unsound mind. 84. Act of a person of unsound mind.--Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. 85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will. 85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.--Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to law: provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. 86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated. 86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.--In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. 87. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       hurt, done by consent. 87. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by consent.--Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. Illustration A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence. 88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit. 88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit.--Nothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm. Illustration A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, but not intending to cause Z's death, and intending, in good faith, Z's benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z's consent. A has committed no offence. 89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian. 89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.--Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             116 any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided-Provisos. Provisos.-First.-That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death; Secondly.-That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; Thirdly.-That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; Fourthly.-That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend. Illustration A, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the child's death, but not intending to cause the child's death. A is within the exception, in as much as his object was the cure of the child. 90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception. 90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.--A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or Consent of insane person. Consent of insane person.-if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         consent; or Consent of child. Consent of child.-unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person who is under twelve years of age. 91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause. 91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.--The exceptions in sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose behalf the consent is given. Illustration Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence inexpediently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence \"by reason of such harm\"; and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. 92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent. 92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.-Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may causes to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided-Provisos. Provisos.-First.-That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death or the attempting to cause death; 117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Secondly.-That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; Thirdly.-That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; Fourthly.-That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend. Illustrations (a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z's death, but in good faith, for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no offence. (b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, and in good faith intending Z's benefit. A's ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. (c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. There is not time to apply to the child's guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good faith, the child's benefit. A has committed no offence. (d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child, from the house-top, knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child's benefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. Explanation.-Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88 89 and 92. 93. Communication made in good faith. 93. Communication made in good faith.--No communication made in good faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. Illustration A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              118 opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death. 94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats. 94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.--Except murder, and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonnably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to such constraint. Explanation 1.-A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. Explantion 2.-A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. 95. Act causing slight harm. 95. Act causing slight harm.--Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. Of the Right of Private Defence 96. Things done in private defence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              96.

Right of private defence of the body and of property.--Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section 99, to defend -First.--His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body; Secondly.--The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence falling under the defintion of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. 98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc. 98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.--When an act which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act which he would have if the act were that offence. Illustrations (a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private defence which he would have if Z were sane. (b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. 99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    119 99.

There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of the public authorities. Extent to which the right may be exercised. Extent to which the right may be exercised.--The right of private defence in no case extends to the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. Explanation 1.-A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the person doing the act is such public servant. Explanation 2.-A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. 100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death. 100.

Explanation 1.-A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. Illustration A, a public officer, is authorized by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C.

Abettor. 108. Abettor.--A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. Explanation 1.-The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. Explanation 2.-To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. Illustrations (a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. (b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. Explanation 3.-It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge. Illustrations (a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence. (b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. (c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence. (d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. Explanation 4.-The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence. Illustration A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. Explanation 5.-It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the 122                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. Illustration A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. 108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India. 1*[108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.--A person abets an offence within the meaning of this Code who, in 2*[India], abets the commission of any act without and beyond 2*[India] which would constitute an offence if committed in 2*[India]. Illustration A, in 2*[India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] 109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment. 109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment.--Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. Explanation.-An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment. Illustrations (a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ----------------------------------------------------------------------123 accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. (b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. (c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A's absence and thereby causes Z's death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. 110. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of abettor. 110. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of abettor.--Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other. 1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. 2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1951, s, 3 and Sch., for \"the States\". 111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done. 111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.--When an Act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had directly abetted it: Proviso. Proviso.--Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment. Illustrations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          (a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here if the child was acting under the influence of A's instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. (b) A instigates B to burn Z's house. B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. (c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for murder. 112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done. 112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.--If the act for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, and constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. Illustration A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence resists that distress. In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the offences. 113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by the abettor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      124 113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by the abettor.--When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the act abetted was likely to cause that effect. Illustration A instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation, causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment provided for murder. 114. Abettor present when offence is committed. 114. Abettor present when offence is committed.--Whenever any person who if absent would be liable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. 115. Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life-if offence is not committed. 115. Abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life--if offence not committed.-Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or 1*[imprisonment for life], shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine: if act causing harm be done in consequence. if act causing harm be done in consequence.--and if any act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable to fine. Illustration A instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the punishment of death or 1*[imprisonment for life]. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to a fine; and, if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and to fine. 116. Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment--if offence be not committed. 116. Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment--if offence be not committed.--Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term provided for that offence; or with such fine as is provided for that offence, or with both; if abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence. if abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.--and if the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with both. Illustrations (a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing. A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B refuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section. (b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence defined in this section, and is punishable accordingly. (c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not committed, A is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------125 (d) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent that offence. Here though the robbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and also to fine. 117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons. 117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons.--Whoever abets the commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. 1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and Sch., for \"transportation for life\". Illustration A affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten members to meet at a certain time and place, for the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse sect, while engaged in a procession. A has committed the offence defined in this section. 118. Concealing design to commit offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life. 118. Concealing design to commit offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life.--Whoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of an offence punishable with death or 1*[imprisonment for life], voluntarily conceals, by any act or illegal omission, the existence of a design to commit such offence or makes any representation which he knows to be false respecting such design, if offence be committed-if offence be not committed. if offence be committed-if offence be not committed.--shall, if                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            that offence be committed, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or, if the offence of not committed, with imprisonment of either description, for a term which may extend to three years; and in either case shall also be liable to fine.

CHAPTER XI OF FALSE EVIDENCE AND OFFENCES AGAINST PUBLIC JUSTICE CHAPTER XI OF FALSE EVIDENCE AND OFFENCES AGAINST PUBLIC JUSTICE 191. Giving false evidence. 191. Giving false evidence.--Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to give false evidence. Explanation 1.-A statement is within the meaning of this section whether it is made verbally or otherwise. Explanation 2.-A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the meaning of this section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing which he does not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing which he does not know. Illustrations (a) A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one thousand rupees, falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z admit the justice of B's claim. A has given false evidence. (b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when he does not believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore gives false evidence. (c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, although the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not knowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not. (e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true interpretation or translation of a statement or document, which he is bound by oath to interpret or translate truly, that which is not and which he does not believe to be a true interpretation or translation. A has given false evidence. 192. Fabricating false evidence. 192. Fabricating false evidence.--Whoever causes any circumstance to exist or makes any false entry in any book or record, or makes any document containing a false statement, intending that such circumstance, false entry or false statement may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law before a public servant as such, or before an arbitrator, and that such circumstance, false entry or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause any person who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding is said \"to fabricate false evidence\". Illustrations (a) A puts jewels into a box belonging to Z, with the intention that they may be found in that box, and that this circumstance may cause Z to be convicted of theft. A has fabricated false evidence. (b) A makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of using it as corroborative evidence in a Court of Justice. A has fabricated false evidence. (c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a criminal conspiracy, writes a letter in imitation of Z's handwriting, purporting to be addressed to an accomplice in such criminal conspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that the officers of the police are likely to search. A has fabricated false evidence. 193. Punishment for false evidence. 193.

Explanation 1.-A trial before a Court-martial 1****is a judicial proceeding. Explanation 2.-An investigation directed by law preliminary to a proceeding before a Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may not take place before a Court of Justice. Illustration A, in an enquiry before a Magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining whether Z ought to be committed for trial, makes on oath a statement which he knows to be false. As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A as given false evidence. Explanation 3.-An investigation directed by a Court of Justice according to law, and conducted under the authority of a Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may not take place before a Court of Justice. Illustration A, in an enquiry before an officer deputed by a Court of Justice to ascertain on the spot the boundaries of land, makes on oath a statement which he knows to be false. As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A has given false evidence. 194. Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of capital offence; 194.

CHAPTER XVI OF OFFENCES AFFECTING THE HUMAN BODY CHAPTER XVI OF OFFENCES AFFECTING THE HUMAN BODY Of offences affecting life 299. Culpable homicide. 299. Culpable homicide.--Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. Illustrations (a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. (b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. (c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              167 although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. Explanation 1.-A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death. Explanation 2.-Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented. Explanation 3.-The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. 300. Murder. 300. Murder.--Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or-2ndly.-If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused. or-3rdly.-If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or-4thly.-If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. Illustrations (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. (b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          168 state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. (c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. (d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. Exception 1.-When culpable homicide is not murder.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. The above exception is subject to the following provisos: -First.-That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person. Secondly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. Thirdly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. Explanation.-Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. Illustrations (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. (b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. (e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. (f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. Exception 2.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence or person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. Illustration Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. Exception 3.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. Exception 4.-Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Explanation.-It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. Exception 5.-Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. Illustration 169                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. 301. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was intended. 301. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was intended.--If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to he likely to cause. 302.

Illustrations (a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the stream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is produced without any other action on any person's part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. (b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. (c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z's consent, in order to the commiss ion of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. (d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        179 (e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water, and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried by Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A has used force to Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. (f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. (g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact must affect Z's sense of feeling, A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. (h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z. 351. Assault. 351. Assault.--Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. Explanation.-Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault. Illustrations (a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike Z. A has committed an assault. (b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             upon Z. (c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, \"I will give you a beating\". Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture explained by the words may amount to an assault. 352.

CHAPTER XVII OF OFFENCES AGAINST PROPERTY CHAPTER XVII OF OFFENCES AGAINST PROPERTY Of theft 378. Theft. 378. Theft.--Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------187 property out of the possession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft. Explanation 1.-A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. 1. Subs, by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and Sch., for \"transportation for life \". Explanation 2.-A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. Explanation 3.-A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. Explanation 4.-A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. Explanation 5.-The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied. Illustrations (a) A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. (b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. (c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. (d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft. (e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   188 (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. (g) A finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft. (i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly. (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. (m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. (n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorized to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. (o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. 379. Punishment for theft. 379.

Illustrations (a) A commits theft on property in Z's possession; and, while committing this theft, he has a loaded pistol under his garment, having provided this pistol for the purpose of hurting Z in case Z should resist. A has committed the offence defined in this section. (b) A picks Z's pocket, having posted several of his companions near him, in order that they may restrain Z, if Z should perceive what is passing and should resist, or should attempt to apprehend A. A has committed the offence defined in this section. Of extortion 383. Extortion. 383. Extortion.--Whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury to that person, or to any other, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property, or valuable security or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security, commits \"extortion\".

(c) A threatens to send club-men to plough up Z's field unless Z will sign and deliver to B a bond binding Z under a penalty to deliver certain produce to B, and thereby induces Z to sign and deliver the bond. A has committed extortion. (d) A, by putting Z in fear of grievous hurt, dishonestly induces Z to sign or affix his seal to a blank paper and deliver it to A. Z sings and delivers the paper to A.

A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. (b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence and takes away a book without Z's express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft.

Explanation 2.-A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner, does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it. What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact. It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular person is the owner of it: it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found. Illustrations (a) A finds a rupee on the high-road, not knowing to whom the rupee belong, A picks up the rupee. Here A has not committed the offence defined in this section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               193 (b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank note.

He is guilty of an offence under this section. (d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A pick up the purse with the intention of restoring it to Z, bu afterwards appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section. (e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that it belongs to Z, and appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section. (f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately without attempting to discover the owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section. 404. Dishonest misappropriation of property possessed by deceased person at the time of his death. 404. Dishonest misappropriation of property possessed by deceased person at the time of his death.-Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use property, knowing that such property was in the possession of a deceased person at the time of that person's decease, and has not since been in the possession of any person legally entitled to such possession, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine, and if the offender at the time of such person's decease was employed by him as a clerk or servant, the imprisonment may extend to seven years.

Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and Sch., for \"transportation for life\". 2. The words \"Trade or\" omitted by Act 43 of 1958, s. 135 and Sch. (w.e.f. 25-11-1959). Illustrations (a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery. (b) A without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. (c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. (d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. (e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. (f) Z's will contains these words-\"I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     205 whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. (g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z< for his order by writing on the bill the words \"Pay to Z or his order\" and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words \"Pay to Z or his order\", and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. (h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery. (i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. (j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. (k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service. Explanation I.-A man's signature of his own name may amount to forgery. Illustrations (a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery. (b) A writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bills as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. (c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. (d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    executes a lease of the estate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. (e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition. Explanation 2.-The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery. Illustration A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery. 465.
